# Cards
Cards are used to separate and highlight elements on dashboards. These are white boxes with a shadow underneath and can contain filters, KPIs, charts, tables and text. Cards can be full width as well as split into multiple cards across a page.

<div class="glightbox-desc custom-desc1">

When multiple elements are within a single card (such as filters or KPIs) then these are separated by grey dividers.
