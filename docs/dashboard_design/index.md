# Dashboard design

We convey our visual identity through the products we build. Design guidelines help us to work together on sophisticated digital products, using a standardised visual language. 
<br>
These guidelines are for developers, product owners and quality assurance testers working on data visualisation products in the NHS.

## Benefits

These design guidelines are useful for:

- [x] **Ensuring consistency**
<br>
<p>Creating a unified visual experience across the product and considering how this links across analytical products will ensure a strong, professional and positive perception</p>

- [x] **Sharing vocabulary**
<br>
<p>Having one document for data visualisation development teams to refer to aids collaboration. These guidelines are a tool which can be relied upon for quicker interation times and consistent digital experiences for users.</p>

- [x] **Faster onboarding**
<br>
<p>Having an agreed style guide will help new team members to get up to speed quickly and enable them to make design decisions, soon after joining us.</p>

- [x] **Standardisation**
<br>
<p>Design guidelines specify the exact sizing and formatting requirements so that NHS front-end developers can follow the same standards.</p>

## Key Principles

???+ tip "Visual Hierarchy"
    The first place your eyes go to is the **top of the screen**. 
    Place important information here for users to easily scan.

### Visual Hierarchy
<p>Visual Hierarchy is the organisation of design elements by importance. It directs a user's attention to enhance their engagement of the information presented.</p>
<p>There are two primary <a href="https://99designs.com/blog/tips/visual-hierarchy-landing-page-designs">reading layouts</a>: Z pattern and F pattern.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/designing-websites-that-mirror-how-our-eyes-work-part-2">Z-pattern layout</a> draws attention to the top-left corner first before moving to the top right, then down to the bottom left, with the bottom-right corner as the last stop. Each corner has a visual cue (like a logo) or CTA (like a contact button).</p>
<p> An <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/text-scanning-patterns-eyetracking/2">F-pattern layout</a>, which follows a more crowded pattern leading visitors from left to right and back again, works well for text-heavy pages.</p>

### White Space

<p>White space separates and groups elements in a dashboard.</p>
<p>It helps the eye to scan a page for information. Without it, your dashboard will be hard to read. </p>
<p>Adding white space reinforces the visual hierarchy of your dashboard. It puts the spotlight on the data in your dashboard. </p>

### Contrast

<p>Contrast directs the user's attention to focal point in your dashboard, highlighting important information to achieve impact.</p>
<p>It is also crucial for practical reasons. For instance, text should have a  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G183.html">contrast ratio of at least 3:1</a> to ensure your dashboard is accessible to all users.</p>
<p>Contrast in size, shape and colour are all important to ensure your dashboard is successful in achieving its specific goal. With no contrast all, you'd just end up with a single colored block for a dashboard!</p> 

### Size and Scale

<p>Size and scale are used in visual hierarchy to communicate prioritized information. </p>
<p>Size refers to the physical dimensions of an element, while scale defines its proportion relative to other elements on the page. Large elements generally attract more attention in the hierarchy, while smaller ones are secondary.</p>
<p>Manipulating the size and scale of your dashboard components creates a sense of perspective, guiding users to focus on the most important information first.</p>
